# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection involves using various methods to identify and prevent unauthorized use of credit cards. This can include monitoring for suspicious activity on a cardholder's account, such as large or unusual purchases, or detecting patterns that may indicate fraud, such as multiple purchases made in a short period of time from different locations. Other techniques used in credit card fraud detection include analyzing transaction data to identify anomalies, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, and implementing security measures such as chip technology and two-factor authentication.
